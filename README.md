# Calculator Using Basic Python
<br>
Welcome to my first project after learning the basics of Python programming!
<br>
<br>
# Project Overview
<br>
I have developed a simple calculator using basic Python constructs such as if-else statements, loops (while), and an error-handling mechanism.
<br>
<br>
# Features
<br>
<b>Error Handling<b>: Invalid input is managed using while loops and try-except blocks to ensure the calculator operates smoothly.
<br>
<b>User Interaction</b>: The entire code is encapsulated within a while loop, allowing the user to perform multiple operations and choose when to exit the calculator.
<br>
<br>
# Future Enhancements
<br>
While this calculator doesn't currently include all Python operations, I plan to add more features soon. For now, I am pleased with this initial achievement and excited to continue improving it.

Thank you for checking out my project!
